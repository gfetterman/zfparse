# zfparse

zfparse layers structure, including motifs, bouts, and phrases, onto a sequence of zebra finch vocalizations.

## Installation

zfparse was written for Python 3.5. Installation with [Conda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) is recommended.

    git clone https://github.com/gfetterman/zfparse
    cd zfparse
    pip install .

The zfparse data-loading function assumes your data is in [Bark](http://github.com/margoliashlab/bark) format, but the parsing itself does not. If your data is not in Bark, writing a custom data-loading routine should not be difficult.
